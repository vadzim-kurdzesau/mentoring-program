Open NumberParser class under Task2 project and implement Parse method to convert a string value to integer. 

It is NOT allowed to use int.Parse(), int.TryParse() or any other built-in conversion methods. 

Error handling should be implemented. All unit tests should pass successfully. 

## Task 3 (Optional): 

Open UserTaskController and UserTaskService classes under Task3 project and change code-based error handling to exception-based one. If you notice any violations of open/close principle, fix them.
