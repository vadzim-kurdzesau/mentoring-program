# Description

You are given a solution (DataStructures.zip) containing the task project and the tests. Your task is to implement methods (details below) until the tests are green. 

## Part 1: 

Implement linked list (DoublyLinkedList.cs) with functions: 

- Length 

- Add 

- AddAt 

- Remove 

- RemoveAt 

- ElementAt 

Implement IEnumerable to make your list work with for each (NOTE: you SHOULD NOT use YIELD operator) 

## Part 2: 

Implement the interface IHybridFlowProcessor<T> (HybridFlowProcessor.cs) using single internal item "storage" for both FILO and FIFO flows. Use a Double linked list in your implementation. Reusing your code from the previous task is desirable. 

## Scoreboard:

1-3 stars – Half of both test classes are green. 

4 stars – All tests in DoublyLinkedListTests.cs and 4 in HybridFlowProcessorTest.cs are green. 

5 stars - all tests are green.
